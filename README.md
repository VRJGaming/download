I regret to inform you that I am resigning from my position of customer service representative for Embassy International, effective Tuesday, August 14. I apologize for not being able to give a full two weeks' notice, but it will be necessary for me to leave before then. I will do my best to get as much of my work done in the meantime so the next employee will have a smooth transition.

Thank you so much for the time I’ve spent at this job. Embassy International continues to be an excellent and supportive company, and I will miss working here very much.
